# Buffalo Chicken Dip

## Ingredients		
3 large boneless skinless chicken breasts - cooked and shredded		
8 ounces cream cheese		
1 cup ranch 		
1 cup + some, hot sauce - (I ususally use Franks buffalo sauce or just normal Franks),		
1 tsp freshly ground black pepper		
1 tsp garlic powder		
1/2 C cheddar cheese shredded		
1/2 C feta or blue cheese crumbles (I prefer feta, but to each their own) 		

## Instructions:		

Stir together all ingredients until well-combined in crock pot.		

Cook on low for 1 1/2 hours or until cheese is melted and dip starts to bubble on edges. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.		

Serve with your favorite chips, crackers, and veggies.
